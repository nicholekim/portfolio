      <h1> Week 5: Data Visualization </h1>
  <p>
    This 2-week project was to create a visualization of a dataset of my choice. I have created my own little dataset of "the regions visited by Anthony Bourdain during the 6 seasons of his TV show, 'Parts Unknown'".
    <br> Anthony Bourdain - a famous American chef & TV celebrity - has visited 8 regions each every season, all across the world.
    <br> I took the places he went, classified them according to the continents they are located at, and created stacked bar graphs for each season. Hovering over each graph reveals the names of the places he has gone to.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dataset credit goes to Netflix "Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown".
