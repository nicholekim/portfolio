  <h1> Nichole Kim's HCDE 598 Portfolio </h1>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm <a href=https://www.nicholekim.com>Nichole Kim</a>, a full time 1st year MS HCDE student. Along with this course, I'm taking 517 and 508 this quarter.
    <br> I come from Psychology background and have not much coding experience- maybe a couple weeks of HTML/CSS and Python in my college years, plus a little dabbling into Java this past summer. I'm definitely looking forward to learning more!

  <h2>Week 1: Digitize</h2>

  <p>
    First week's homework was to digitize a piece of art. My work was inspired by a modern art piece from MOMA website. <a href="DigitizeNK">You can view my project here.</a> Below is the original image for my inspiration.

  <h2> Week 2: Lego Family</h2>

  <p>
    Second project was to create a family of legos that move on the screen & eventually come together in the center. My inspiration was the movie "Inside Out" -- you can see 5 main characters of the movie in my project. <a href="LegoFamily">Check out how they move right here!</a>
    <br>

  <h2> Week 3: Interactive Monster </h2>

  <p>
    Week three's homework was to create a monster that is interactive -- you are able to move the monster's eyes using your mouse, and also make him jump by clicking on it! <a href="InteractiveM">Here's my interactive minion.</a>
    <br>

  <h2> Week 4: Creativity Exploration </h2>

  <p>
    This week's homework was to create two little projects that required me to be creative & use all the tools we've learned so far in p5.js.
    <br>First project I made is a rocket you can move up and down using the arrow keys. As you travel up and down, the scenery also changes. <a href="Project2">Here's my Rocket project.</a>
    <br>Second project is a seashore where waves can move by mic sound & the mouse movement. <a href="Project1">Here's my Waves project.</a>
    <br>

  <h2> Week 5: Data Visualization </h2>

  <p>
    This 2-week project was to create a visualization of a dataset of my choice. I have created my own little dataset of "the regions visited by Anthony Bourdain during the 6 seasons of his TV show, 'Parts Unknown'".
    <a href="dataViz">You can check out my data visualization here!</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Dataset credit goes to Netflix "Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown".
