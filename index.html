Hi there! I'm Nichole Kim, a full time 1st year MS HCDE student. <br>
Along with this course, I'm taking 517 and 508 this quarter. <br>
I come from Psychology background and have not much coding experience- <br>
maybe a couple weeks of HTML/CSS and Python in my college years, plus a little dabbling into Java this past summer.  <br>
I'm definitely looking forward to learning more! <br>

<br>
